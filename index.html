        <p>Our team consists of Jordan Knox, Mickey Matiss, and Brian Fu. We plan to create a point cloud to mesh converter. The point cloud to mesh renderer will take as input a point cloud, and output a mesh that can be easily rendered to accurately represent the subject of the original point mesh.</p>

          <h4>Problem Description</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="body-section">
        <p>
            At this point in class, we have rendered many different materials, objects, and scenes, from a lot of different sources to render off of. We have not yet rendered objects using point clouds. Point clouds are very easy
            ways to measure and represent 3D objects through data. In this project we are aiming to convert point clouds to a mesh representation so as to accurately render objects in the 3D space from point cloud data. The cloud data is typically obtained through 3D scanners. Once the point cloud is obtained, 
            we can then represent the subject visually through a mesh. It will be challenging to accurately connect the points into vertices and deciding which algorithms and methods of reconstruction to use in order to render the correct final product.

          <h4>Goals &amp; Deliverables</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="body-section">
        <p>Our main goal is to produce a renderer that can take in a point cloud and output a mesh that matches the subject of the point cloud.</p>
        <p>We plan to deliver a renderer that can output a mesh from a point cloud. We plan to do so using the ball pivot algorithm.</p>
        <p>Some issues we could encounter would be getting point clouds with enough points to create an accurate mesh representation. Another issue we could encounter would be not knowing where to continue the ball pit algorithm if we have completed filling in the pit.</p>
        <p>Ideally, if we are ahead of schedule and have time, we would like to enable our renderer to create the mesh from a picture instead of specifically a point cloud. Which would require figuring out a way to calculate depth from pictures.</p>

        <p>We have split the overall schedule into 4 sections. We have given each section about a week to complete:
          <ol>
            <li>Convert point cloud into vertices</li>
            <li>Calculating best circle size and where to start</li>
            <li>Using ball pivot algorithm to recreate simple meshes</li>
            <li>Using ball pivot algorithm to recreate more advanced meshes</li>
