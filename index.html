      <div class="body-section">
        <p>Our team consists of Jordan Knox, Mickey Matiss, and Brian Fu. We plan to create a VR application that allows for users to view and attend their zoom lectures in virtual reality. This would make the zoom lectures much closer to the regular lectures for those who prefer in person lectures to webcasts.</p>

          <h4>Problem Description</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="body-section">
        <p>There is obviously something to be said of in person instruction over online instruction. Even for large lectures that do not guarantee interaction between every student and the professor. If there were none, then by now, most schools would have already been online schools. Given our current situation many, if not all,
            schools and classes have been forced online only. We would like to provide a solution for making online lectures more similar to real in person lectures. Our plan, is to create a virtual lecture hall, in which the recording of the professor instructing is actually onstage, their slides are actually displayed, and other students in teh lecture will be projeted beside you.
             This will give those who prefer in person lecture a much more realistic learning experience, and will hopefully help to alleviate some of the stress we are all dealing with.

          <h4>Goals &amp; Deliverables</h4>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="body-section">
        <p>Our main goal is to produce a virtual lecture hall in which students can experience their lectures.</p>
        <p>Our hope is that we are able to get live zoom lectures represented in a virtual reality format. This would include a presenter (professor) being the focus and main stage. The presenter's materials (lecture slides) displayed similarly to real life. And other students and their audio around the student as it would be in a real lecture.</p>
        <p>In order to deliver on our goals, we need to figure out a way to effectively stitch together the images from the zoom lectures and background imagery in order to create an accurate lecture hall. We also need to sort and position the audio sources so that they represent the environment we would like to create.</p>
        <p>If we encounter problems with incorporating the other users who are not the focus (other students) we would transition into only representing the lecturer and their material in a virtual lecture hall. But if things went well, we would try to add the ability for the world to not only show audio of the other students, but make their video appear in a similar manner as the presenter.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="body-section">
        <p>We have split the overall schedule into 4 sections. We have given each section about a week to complete:
          <ol>
            <li>Split lectures into different video and audio files accordingly</li>
            <li>Assemble VR environment without added lecture files</li>
            <li>Stitch parsed lecture video files into VR environment</li>
            <li>Position Audio sources in the VR environment</li>
          </ol>
